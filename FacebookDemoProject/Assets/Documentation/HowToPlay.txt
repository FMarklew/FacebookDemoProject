How To Play
- Camera can be rotated using right click and dragging the mouse
- Throwable can be thrown by using left click, this will aim at the crosshair visible on the screen
- When all blue cubes are gone, the level will reset after 5 seconds
- Players can reset the level manually with the "R" key

How To Design Your Own Level
- Create empty scene
- Bring in CoreFunctionality Prefab
- Design a floor and geometry as desired (make sure they are not on the ScoreCube layer)
	- Movable objects should have rigid bodies and can reflect their mass as required
- Add in score cube prefabs, each of these will add to the total score required
- Add in ScoreHitBoxes as required, you will want one around the ground level so cubes that fall to the floor are counted
	- Can also add some to the extents of the map so any that are launched outside are also counted
